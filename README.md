# CNN_Fashion-MNIST-Classification
Initial understanding of PyTorch framework with Fashion MNIST dataset.

1. Choosing a small number of training inputs in each batch.
2. Adjusted multiple parameters depending on accuracy.
3. Acheived the Training Accuracy of 90%.
4. Classify the predictions using confusion matrix.
